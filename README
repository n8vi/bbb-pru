Texas instruments provides a package of toys for the beaglebone's
PRUs, which contains an assembler, a library, headers, and example
files, at https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package.  

This is a simplification of that package which does not contain
the examples, but does allow you to do "make install" and have an
immediately working PRU environment.  I've ripped out the bits
that print the host CPU name at odd moments, and will likely
upgrade to TI's code soonish.

If you want examples, you can still look at TI's code, or you
can check out my PRU-based DDS at https://github.com/n8vi/pru-dds8.

I am not an employee of Texas Instruments, and I am not responsible
for any damages caused by this code.  It's not even my code, I am
repackaging it!  See TI's source files for their legal information.
