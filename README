Texas instruments provides a package of toys for the beaglebone's
PRUs, which contains an assembler, a library, headers, and example
files, at https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package.  

This is a simplification of that package which does not contain
the examples, but does allow you to do "make install" and have an
immediately working PRU environment.

If you're feeling dangerous, your Beaglebone was just taken out
of the box, and it has a solid internet connection, you can try
doing "make doallthethings" to get git and ntp working.  Let me
emphasize here though that you should only do this if you don't
mind doing a complete reinstall because those make targets work
in the most dangerous and lazily written way possible.

If you want examples, you can still look at TI's code, or you
can check out my PRU-based DDS at https://github.com/n8vi/pru-dds8.

I am not an employee of Texas Instruments, and I am not responsible
for any damages caused by this code.  It's not even my code, I am
repackaging it!  See TI's source files for their legal information.
